# DSA in C

This repository contains my progress in learning Data Structures and Algorithms using C, structured across two distinct tracks: college coursework and personal practice.

---

## dsa-college/

This folder contains programs and assignments from my college DSA lectures.

### Day 1 – Structures
- Declaring and initializing structures
- Reading input into a struct array
- Writing functions that accept or return structs
- Comparing student data using pointer-based functions

Folder: `dsa-college/day1_structs/`

---

## dsa-personal/

This folder includes my personal practice work, going beyond what’s covered in class.

### Day 1 – Arrays
Folder: `dsa-personal/day1-arrays/`
- Finding the second largest element
- Right-shifting array elements
- Reversing arrays using pointer logic

### Day 2 – Functions
Folder: `dsa-personal/day2-functions/`
- Swapping numbers using pointers
- Reversing arrays with helper functions
- Finding first occurrence of an element

## Folder Workflow

| Track     | Folder Path            | Focus                  |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------------|
| College   | `dsa-college/`         | Lecture-based programs |
| Personal  | `dsa-personal/`        | Practice and revision  |

Each practice day is stored in its own subfolder with a clear naming convention like `day1-arrays` or `day2-functions`.
