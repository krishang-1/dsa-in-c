# DSA in C

This repo contains daily solved DSA problems in C, organized by day and topic.

## Structure

- `dsa-day1-arrays/` – Array problems: reverse, shift, second largest
- `dsa-day2-functions/` – Pointer problems: swap, reverse, find with pointers
- `dsa-day3-strings/` – (upcoming) Strings, recursion, frequency analysis

Each day builds on the previous one. Code is written with clarity, readability, and low-level control in mind.
